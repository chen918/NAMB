This file contains 12 scripts for the simulation study of robustness analysis of the incongruent model pairs. 1 is for the probit latent model; 2 is for the logistic latent model; 3 is for the logistic mean model; and 4 is for the probit mean model. Therefore, robust12 is the script which generates the data using the probit latent model but estimates the model with logistic latent model.
