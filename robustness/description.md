This file contains 12 scripts for the simulation studies that evaluated the robustness of the models when the data are generated under a different model. Each script corresponds to one of the 12 incongruent model-data generation pairs under the uniform prior for rho. 

The file names include two digits with the first digit corresponding to the model that generated the data and the second digit to the model estimated on the data. The digits are coded as follows: 1 for the probit latent model; 2 for the logistic latent model; 3 for the logistic mean model; and 4 for the probit mean model. Therefore, as an example, robust12 is the script which generates the data using the probit latent model but estimates the model using logistic latent model. Other scripts are named in the same manner.
